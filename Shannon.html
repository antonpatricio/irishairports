                    <div class="information">
                        Shannon Airport, also know as SNN, is a key international airport serving the west 
                        of Ireland. Located in County Clare, it offers flights to a range of destinations across
                        Europe and North America, playing a vital role in connecting the region for business and
                        leisure travel. It serves as the primary gateway for counties Clare, Limerick, Galway and 
                        beyond, providing convenient access to the regional area.
                        <br><br>
                        They are actively seeking to expands its route network to offer more destinations for both
                        business and leisure travelers. This includes transatlantic routes and connections within Europe.

                            Prior to March 2020, Shannon Airport experienced consistently high monthly passenger numbers. There is seasonal patterns 
                            evident with passenger traffic peaking during the summer month, August 2019 where there was a total of 187,029 passengers,
                            likely driven by leisure travel, holiday periods, and tourist activity. Conversely, troughs are seen during the winter month 
                            December 2019 where there were only 99,050 passengers.

                            The scatter plot shown reinforces the stability shown in the line graph and bar graph. The concentration 
                            of the graph indicates that Shannon Airport was relatively busy pre-pandemic. It is cleear that passenger 
                            numbers remained high and predictable towards early 2020.

                            The sharp drop from 86,800 to 43,454 in passenger numbers in the graphs starting in March 2020 clearly highlights
                            the drastic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of the travel restrictions. This disruption altered
                            the trends of the passenger numbers and shows a massive contrast to the pre-pandemic period.

                            The most striking feature shown in the graphs is the sudden plunge in passenger numbers starting in March 2020, where 
                            it nearly halved the passenger total in the previous month (February). This coincides with the onset of the COVID-19
                            pandemic and the implementation of travel restrictions and lockdowns globally.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Throughout the rest of 2020 and into 2021, passenger numbers remained way lower than pre-pandemic levels and at times had 0 passengers. In August of 2020,
                            the passenger totalled to 19,871 which compared to last years total, 187,029, shows the critical impact of the pandemic
                            on air travel due to border closures and safety concerns.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However while still generally low, it is evident that there are minor fluctuations in passenger numbers during the pandemic 
                            period. These likely correspond to periods of restrictions being eased or increased travel during holiday seasons, followed by
                            renewed restrictions as case numbers fluctuated due to this increase in air travel.

                            From the low point in the end of 2021, we can see a gradual upward trend in passenger numbers. In 2021, passenger numbers peaked in
                            October where numbers reached to 71,853 passengers which compared to 2020's peak month, August, where it reached 19,871,
                            shows how travel restrictions are being eased and vaccination rate increasing allowing people to travel again.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However, it's important to note that even by January 2022, passenger numbers peaked at only 42,015 which shows that Shannon Airport 
                            has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. This indicates that the aviation industry still faced challenges during this period 
                            and was still ongoing recovery.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is until April 2023 passenger numbers seem to have recovered significantly and is evidently shown to
                            have slightly increased from the Pre-Pandemic period. In August 2024, Shannon Airport reached a peak of 231,125 which is the
                            highest point on the graphs. This points out the increased demand in air travel for people in Ireland.

                            Look at the data, there is clearly trends for seasonality. Shannon Airport should optimize staffing levels to match the levels of
                            passengers coming into the airport. By increasing staff during peak summer months and reducing staff during the off-season, Shannon Airport 
                            can minimise their costs for staffing and have smoother staff management throughout the year.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The huge increase in passengers Post-Pandemic compared to Pre-Pandemic shows the increased demand and use for Shannon Airport. Shannon Airport should consider
                            future infrastructure expansive to accomodate the increased traffic and to promote their intentions of developing Shannon Airport. This could include expanding 
                            terminal capacity, adding gates, or improving baggage handling systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Marketing campaigns can be developed by travel agencies to encourage travel during the off-season to smooth out demand and utilise airport capacity
                            more efficiently. This could include promoting special events, offering discounts, or bringing in tour operators. They can also highlight the airport's 
                            successful recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic to reassure travelers to return to Shannon Airport.

                    <div class="information">
                        Dublin Airport, also know as DUB, is Ireland's main international gateway.
                        It is located 10km north of Dublin City, it serves as a major hub for Aer Lingus
                        and Ryanair, offering flights to destinations across Europe, North America, and
                        the Middle East. With two main terminals, Dublin Airport caters millions of passengers
                        annually, providing a range of services and facilities including shops, restaurants and lounges.
                        <br><br>
                        As Ireland's largest and busiest airport, Dublin Airport serves as a vital hub for international
                        travel and trade, connecting Ireland with destinations across the globe.

                            Prior to March 2020, the monthly passenger numbers at Dublin Airport were consistent and high.
                            There are signs of peak trends in the summer months, likely due to holiday travel, and dips in trends 
                            in the winter season. The graphs shows Dublin Airport reaching it's peak at 3.43 Million passengers 
                            in July for the year 2019.

                            The scatter plot shown reinforces the stability shown in the line graph and bar graph. The concentration 
                            of the graph indicates that Dublin Airport was consistently busy pre-pandemic. It is cleear that passenger 
                            numbers remained high and predictable towards early 2020.

                        <li>
                            The sharp drop from 2 Million to 1 Million in passenger numbers in the graphs starting in March 2020 clearly highlights
                            the drastic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of the travel restrictions. This demonstrates just how
                            robust the airport's traffic was before the pandemic hit.

                            The most striking feature shown in the graphs is the sudden plunge in passenger numbers starting in March 2020, where 
                            it nearly halved the passenger total in the previous month (February). This coincides with the onset of the COVID-19
                            pandemic and the implementation of travel restrictions and lockdowns globally.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Throughout the rest of 2020 and into 2021, passenger numbers remained lower than pre-pandemic levels. In July of 2020,
                            the passenger totalled to 374,443 which compared to last years total, 3.43 Million, shows the critical impact of the pandemic
                            on air travel due to border closures and safety concerns.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However while still generally low, it is evident that there are minor fluctuations in passenger numbers during the pandemic 
                            period. These likely correspond to periods of restrictions being eased or increased travel during holiday seasons, followed by
                            renewed restrictions as case numbers fluctuated due to this increase in air travel.

                           From the low point in early 2021, we can see a gradual upward trend in passenger numbers. In 2021, passenger numbers peaked in
                           October where numbers reached to 1.54 Million passengers which compared to 2020's peak month, August, where it reached 509,000,
                           shows how travel restrictions are being eased and vaccination rate increasing allowing people to travel again.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However, it's important to note that even by January 2022, passenger numbers peaked at only 969,467 which shows that Dublin Airport 
                            has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. This indicates that the aviation industry still faced challenges during this period 
                            and was still ongoing recovery.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is until January 2023 passenger numbers seem to have recovered significantly and is evidently shown to
                            have slightly increased from the Pre-Pandemic period. In August 2024, Dublin Airport reached a peak of 3.63 Million which is the
                            highest point on the graphs. This points out the increased demand in air travel for people all over Ireland.

                        <li>
                            From reviewing the data, there is clearly trends for seasonality. Dublin Airport should optimize staffing levels to match the levels of
                            passengers coming into the airport. By increasing staff during peak summer months and reducing staff during the off-season, Dublin Airport 
                            can minimise their costs for staffing and have smoother staff management throughout the year.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Given that the peak number of the data was during August 2024, it leads us to expect that the number of passengers for August 2025 will be even 
                            greater than 2024. Dublin Airport should consider future infrastructure expansive to accomodate the increased traffic. This could include expanding 
                            terminal capacity, adding gates, or improving baggage handling systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Marketing campaigns can be developed by travel agencies to encourage travel during the off-season to smooth out demand and utilise airport capacity
                            more efficiently. This could include promoting special events, offering discounts, or bringing in tour operators. They can also highlight the airport's 
                            successful recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic to reassure travelers to return to Dublin Airport.

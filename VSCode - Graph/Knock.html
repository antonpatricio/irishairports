                    <div class="information">
                        Ireland West Airport ( Knock ), also known as NOC, is a growing international airport serving
                        the west and northwest of Ireland. It is located in County Mayo and offeres a range of domestic
                        and international flights, primarily within Europe and the UK. Knock Airport plays a vital role
                        in providing a convenient gateway for those living in the west and northwest, and boosting the local
                        economy through tourism and connectivity.
                        <br><br>
                        They are focusing on expanding its route network and improving facilities to enchance the passengers
                        experience and support future growth in the region.

                            Prior to March 2020, Knock Airport experienced consistently high monthly passenger numbers. There is seasonal patterns 
                            evident with passenger traffic peaking during the summer month, August 2019 where there was a total of 94,907 passengers,
                            likely driven by leisure travel, holiday periods, and tourist activity. Conversely, troughs are seen during the winter month 
                            December 2019 where there were only 52,899 passengers.

                            The scatter plot shown reinforces the stability shown in the line graph and bar graph. The concentration 
                            of the graph indicates that Knock Airport was relatively busy pre-pandemic. It is cleear that passenger 
                            numbers remained high and predictable towards early 2020.

                        <li>
                            The sharp drop from 45,263 to 22,436 in passenger numbers in the graphs starting in March 2020 clearly highlights
                            the drastic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of the travel restrictions. This disruption altered
                            the trends of the passenger numbers and shows a massive contrast to the pre-pandemic period.

                            The most striking feature shown in the graphs is the sudden plunge in passenger numbers starting in March 2020, where 
                            it nearly halved the passenger total in the previous month (February). This coincides with the onset of the COVID-19
                            pandemic and the implementation of travel restrictions and lockdowns globally.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Throughout the rest of 2020 and into 2021, passenger numbers remained way lower than pre-pandemic levels and at times had 0 passengers. In August of 2020,
                            the passenger totalled to 13,707 which compared to last years total, 94,907, shows the critical impact of the pandemic
                            on air travel due to border closures and safety concerns.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However while still generally low, it is evident that there are minor fluctuations in passenger numbers during the pandemic 
                            period. These likely correspond to periods of restrictions being eased or increased travel during holiday seasons, followed by
                            renewed restrictions as case numbers fluctuated due to this increase in air travel.

                            From the low point in the end of 2021, we can see a gradual upward trend in passenger numbers. In 2021, passenger numbers peaked in
                            October where numbers reached to 42,943 passengers which compared to 2020's peak month, August, where it reached 13,707,
                            shows how travel restrictions are being eased and vaccination rate increasing allowing people to travel again.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However, it's important to note that even by January 2022, passenger numbers peaked at only 13,820 which shows that Knock Airport 
                            has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. This indicates that the aviation industry still faced challenges during this period 
                            and was still ongoing recovery.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is until April 2023 passenger numbers seem to have recovered significantly and is evidently shown to
                            have slightly increased from the Pre-Pandemic period. In August 2023, Knock Airport reached a peak of 101,736 which is the
                            highest point on the graphs. This points out the increased demand in air travel for people in Ireland.

                            Knock Airport evidently carries a relatively smaller amount of passengers compared to Dublin Airport and Cork Airport, consideration into future infrastructure
                            expansion will make it more appealing for travelers to go to the airport and will bring upward trends in future datasets. Expansions can
                            include expanding the terminal capacity, adding gates, or improving baggage handling systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Given that the peak number of the data was during August 2023, it shows that the passenger trends are not increasing massively annually. Knock Airport should
                            consider future infrastructure expansive to attract more travelers to the airport. This could include expanding terminal capacity, adding gates, or improving
                            baggage handling systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Attracting new airlines and routes will be essential in the growth of Knock Airport. By expanding the airport's connectivity, the people 
                            in the region are given more opportunities to go to a closer airport for their travels instead of going all the way to Dublin Airport. By 
                            introducing new routes, more tourists will flock the region which will boost their economy.

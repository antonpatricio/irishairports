                            The most striking feature is the massive 85.6% held by Dublin Airport. This clearly shows its position as a primary hub
                            for air travel in Ireland. This demonstrates its role in handling the vast majority of air traffic in the country,
                            emphasizing its national and international importance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The remaining airports (Cork, Shannon, Knock, and Kerry) all have significantly smaller slices on the pie graph. This
                            highlights the concentration of air travel in Dublin. While these airports serve vital regional roles, their passenger
                            numbers are shortened by Dublin.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            With 6.81%, Cork Airport has the second-largest slice on the pie graph. While still much smaller than Dublin, it stands out
                            as the busiest of the regional airports. It shows its significance as a gateway for the south of Ireland.

                    <p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
                    <p>
                        The pie chart is evidently useful as it demonstrates the constrast between Dublin Airport and the rest of the airports in Ireland.
                        This stark contrast could lead to a discussion about regional development and expansion for these airports. However while their
                        slices are small, they serve an important role in providing air access to specific regions of Ireland, supporting local economies and tourism.

                            Like the pie graph, the bar graph clearly demonstrates the dominance of Dublin Airport in terms of passenger numbers. The tallest
                            bar for Dublin towers over all the other airports which reinforces its primary role in Irish aviation. The graph allows for a clear
                            ranking of airports by passenger volume: Dublin, followed by Cork, then Shannon, Knock, and Kerry.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Unlike the pie chart, this bar graph animates through the dates January 2019 until November 2024 which vividly shows the increasing
                            and decreasing passenger total for each month in that period. This allows further analysis to see the passenger total for a specific
                            airport during a certain time period.
                        </li>

                            Around April 2020 until June 2021, there was almost zero passengers flying in and out of Ireland. Even after June 2021, the amount of 
                            passengers taking flights had decreased significantly. This was during the time when Ireland had to go into lockdown due to the Covid-19 
                            pandemic which closed many businesses, including airports.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
                    <p>
                        From this animated bar graph, the total amount of passengers being handled each month can be identified clearly. The animation shows how badly airports
                        across Ireland were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, especially for Dublin Airport. This demonstrates the financial losses experienced by people
                        in the aviation industry and the amount of jobs lost for those in this sector.

                        <li>
                            The most prominent feature is the sharp drop in passenger numbers across all airports around March 2020. This further backs-up my previous analysis
                            on the bar graph where it visually demonstrates the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the travel restrictions on air travel in Ireland.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The graph shows the gradual recovery of passenger numbers after the initial plunge. However, it is clearly shown that the recovery is uneven and takes time.
                            The lines trend upwards, but it's important to note that the levels are not consistently back to pre-pandemic levels, especially for the regional airports.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Aside from Covid-19, the bar graph also demonstrates recurring patterns suggesting potential seasonality in air travel. There are peaks and troughs visibly shown 
                            that may correspond to holiday periods or seasonal travel trends, especially during June, July and August where students are on their summer holidays.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
                    <p>
                        The line graph provides clear information for analysis on passenger numbers at Irish Airports. The devastating impact of Covid-19, the post-pandemic recovery, and 
                        the seasonal trends were all easily identified from the graph making it extremely useful. It underscores the challenges the challenges and resilience of Irish aviation.
